                <h2>Software Engineering</h2>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p> This was the first project I did working in a semi large group. It was a team of 6 people, and I was choosen as the team lead.</p>
				<br />
				<p> We worked for one semester as a team inorder to deliver a web app that allows our client to host a portal allowing people to select drawable plots from an image. We save the selections to display to others what is already taken, so no one can overlap. </p>
				<br />
				<h4>Languages</h4>
				<p>HTML / CSS / JS / PHP</p>
				<br />
				<p>We choose these for ease of creating sample web pages that the client can use as the requirement was not arround the front end, but the backend in the ablility to select and save plots</p>
				<br />
				<p>PHP was our go to due to the team knowing more on that as a whole, allowing everyone to contribute in the project, giving a sense of accomplishment to the team as a whole</p>
